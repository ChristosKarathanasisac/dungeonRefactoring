{"format": "You wake up at %s. Your head hurts and you can't remember what happened to you. You were born in a city called Everdusk and raised by your parents: a man who worked as a trader and a woman who helped him with his business and owned the local watermill. Your instincts tell you to pick up something to hit your enemies with. As you are not physically strong, you don't think you would last very long unarmed."}
